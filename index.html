                <p>
                    As someone who's played video games for most of my life, I find myself enjoying the process of iterative problem solving. 
                    Naturally, I was drawn to programming as a profession and hobby, not only because I would want to ideally make my own games in the future, but because the process of programming itself if built upon the iterative problem solving I enjoy.
                    In 2021, I resolved to get a more formal education through Thaddeus Stevens, ready to take on the challenges ahead.
